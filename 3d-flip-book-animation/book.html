                    <p>
                        There are three gates to this self-destructive hell: lust, anger, and greed. Renounce these three..!! <br><br>
                        Calmness, gentleness, silence, self-restraint, and purity: these are the disciplines of the mind..! <br><br>
                        Man is made by his belief. As he believes, so he is. <br><br>
                        The mind alone is one’s friend as well as one’s enemy. <br><br>
                        Krishna says: "Arjuna, I am the taste of pure water and the radiance of the sun and moon. I am the sacred word and the sound heard in air, and the courage of human beings. I am 	the sweet fragrance in the earth and the radiance of fire; I am the life in every creature and the striving of the spiritual aspirant..!!
